                I'm doing some research on black holes for a science video
                contest. I want to explain the physics of how they work, but
                also want to have a little background on how they're formed. As
                far as I've searched, black holes are predicted by general
                relativity (GR). But I saw this site that said 'general
                relativity is inaccurate at very small sizes' and that it kind
                deviates from GR. So I want to confirm whether black holes

                someone please help? Thanks.

                The Schwarzschild solution, developed by Karl Schwarzschild in
                1916 [1], is the first closed-form, explicit solution of
                Einstein's field equations for gravitation. It describes a
                spherically symmetric, static, vacuum spacetime. The solution
                goes singular at a specific radius (the Schwarzschild radius).
                In the weak field limit, it correctly replicates the Newtonian
                gravitational field of a compact object.
              </p>
              <p class="tags22">
                Though Birkhoff's theorem (general relativity's version of the
                shell theorem) was not yet known in 1916, the Schwarzschild
                solution was nonetheless recognized as the general relativistic
                description of the gravitational field outside a compact
                gravitating body. The fact that it went singular at the
                Schwarzschild radius was either ignored or taken to imply that
                objects that are as small as, or smaller than, this radius
                cannot exist.
              </p>
              <p class="tags22">
                In any case, just because a solution exists in general
                relativity does not mean that objects described by that solution
                exist in Nature. (E.g., the field equations admit solutions that
                blatantly violate causality; yet I don't see any time machines
                out there.) For all they knew, the Schwarzschild solution was
                nothing more than a mathematical curiosity, an idealized case
                that does not describe reality.
              </p>
              <p class="tags22">
                For this reason, I'd suggest that a much more groundbreaking
                paper is that of Oppenheimer and Snyder from 1939 [2]. This
                paper demonstrates that a spherical cloud of dust initially at
                rest will undergo "continued gravitational contraction". An
                observer that is falling with the collapsing matter would see
                total collapse in a finite amount of time, but to a distant
                observer, the collapse will continue forever, the object
                asymptotically approaching, but never quite reaching, its
                Schwarzschild radius. And it was in 1957 I believe that Regge
                and Wheeler first demonstrated that a Schwarzschild singularity
                is stable under small perturbations [3], i.e., perfect symmetry
                is not required. (Wheeler, of course, was also the first to
                popularize the name, "black hole".)
              </p>
              <p class="tags22">
                Lastly, as I was reminded in a comment, we should not forget
                Penrose's 1965 singularity theorem [4], which introduces the
                concept of a trapped surface and shows that gravitational
                collapse is indeed a very generic feature of general relativity.
                After all, this is the result that earned Penrose the 2020 Nobel
                prize in physics.
              </p>
              <p class="tags22">
                In light of that, I think we can confidently state that general
                relativity predicts black holes, but only because we know not
                only that black hole solutions exist, but also that physically
                realizable configurations of matter can collapse into black
                holes (or, at the very least, to objects observationally
                indistinguishable from black holes, which of course may
                evaporate in stupendously long but finite timeframes due to
                Hawking radiation [5]) and that the solutions are stable under
                small perturbations, i.e., perfect symmetry is not a
                prerequisite.

                  However, the existence of a singularity is interpreted by many

                General relativity predicts that matter (technically
                matter/energy: because of E=mc2 they're the same) distorts
                spacetime. If there is enough matter in a small enough region of
                space, it distorts spacetime so much that all futures in that
                region point inwards. What that means is anything in that region
                of space - whether its gross matter, or light (photons), or
                anything else, will be unable to avoid its future being closer
                to the "centre" of that region. Hence why light and matter cant
                escape, hence why its "black".

                  and nothing can escape, is known as the event horizon. Because
                  like the horizon, we can't see events beyond it.To be clear,
                  nothing physical exists at the event horizon, it's a bit like

                  towards: the gravitational centre. GR predicts that this is a

                  if that's correct, perhaps quantum effects prevent that from
                  happening and the centre of a black hole doesn't go all the
                  way to literally zero size, perhaps it has some tiny size on a

                  distinguish between them. Theory says that the only properties
                  of a black hole that allow us (from outside) to tell them
                  apart, are their mass, rotation, and charge. Again, we
                  currently believe this but we don't 100% know.

                When we refer to a black hole, we usually mean the region of
                space for which the event horizon is a boundary.

                Its worth mentioning one common misunderstanding, that the event
                horizon is where gravity becomes infinite. It isn't. The event
                horizon is the boundary of a region in space, where gravity
                becomes intense enough that nothing can travel from inside it to
                outside, and anything inside can only travel "more inside" in
                its future. If the black hole is enormous, then in theory, the
                event horizon could be so far from the singularity (or
                whatever's at the centre), that gravity at the event horizon is
                intense but not enough to rip you apart, so you wouldn't notice
                when you cross it. Or at least a smaller particle or molecule
                wouldn't - you might as you're larger!
              </p>
              <p class="tags22">
                From outside, as we watch an object approaching the event
                horizon, it looks completely different. Light finds it harder
                and harder to escape, and in effect is slowed down slower and
                slower. As it's slowed, it also redshifts - which doesnt mean
                its literally red, it means whatever the wavelength is, it
                becomes longer and longer wavelength, so it could be redshifted
                to microwaves, radio waves etc. Closer to the event horizon this
                effect becomes stronger and stronger, light is slowed more and
                more, becomes longer and longer wavelength.... So to us it looks
                like time has frozen. We see the object getting closer and close
                to the event horizon, dimmer and dimmer, but we never see it
                passing the event horizon. It looks like its just frozen
                eternally moving sloooower. That's an illusion. The object
                passes the event horizon without necessarily noticing anything
                unusual at that point in space, and continues
                moving/accelerating inward within the black hole, just like any
                freely falling object in an intense gravitational field. But we
                from outside never see that part though.

                If the singularity is actually a singularity, GR predicts it's
                never visible/detectable to anyone, as it's only ever in the
                future for light and visibility purposes wherever you are in the
                black hole (technically it would only ever be in the future
                light cone for all points, so no signals can reach any observer
                from it, however close). So you don't even know you get there
                until you do. In fact, technically its not even correct to call
                it a point - its more like an infinitesimal or zero size gap in
                the geometry of spacetime, if GR is correct. (This paragraph

                If you survive long enough to look around, after crossing the
                event horizon, you'd notice a few other odd things. You'd notice
                that the event horizon still seems to appear to be in front of
                you. That's because even within the event horizon, light still
                can't escape any further outwards (all of a photon's futures are
                directed inward, like yours). So the same effect that stopped
                you seeing objects beyond the event horizon before, stops you
                seeing objects in front of you now, even when you're inside the
                event horizon. Another effect is, you can't avoid the
                singularity, and spacetime is so distorted, that the singularity
                is in fact in any/every direction for you, wherever you are.
                Every direction you go, or try to move in, takes you closer to
                it. However you try to move, whatever direction, however fast,
                you'll end up there in a finite amount of time. But because
                everything's futures are inward directed, you just won't know
                you're there until you actually are (because signals can't reach
                you from there).
